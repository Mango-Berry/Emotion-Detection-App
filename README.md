# Emotion-Detection-App
- An colaborative app produced using python. This app looks at images and, using a convolutional neural network, tells the user its best guess of what the emotion showcased in the image may be.

# Goals
- To learn more about neural networks
- To create something that people can use, specifically for those who have difficulty identifying emotions
